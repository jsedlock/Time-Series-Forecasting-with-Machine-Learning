## Introduction

Energy consumption forecasting plays a crucial role in optimizing energy usage, improving energy efficiency, and making informed decisions. This project utilizes the XGBoost algorithm, a gradient boosting framework, to predict energy consumption based on historical data. By training the model on past energy consumption patterns, we can generate accurate forecasts for future energy demand.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains historical energy consumption data. Each data point includes a timestamp and the corresponding energy consumption value. It is important to ensure that the dataset is preprocessed and formatted appropriately for time series forecasting tasks. This may involve handling missing values, normalizing the data, and splitting it into training and testing sets.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

Python 3.x
NumPy
Pandas
XGBoost
Scikit-learn

## Results

After running the prediction jupyter notebook, the forecasted energy consumption values will be stored in a separate file or displayed on the console. Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), or R-squared value.
